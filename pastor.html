            “I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.” <em>Phill. 4:13</em>
            <br>
            "And we know all things work together for good to them who love the Lord and are called according to his purpose”. <em>Rom. 8:28</em>
            <br><br>
            Born to Rev. Otis L. Rush Sr. and Mrs. Alma Rush on Dec. 26, 1951, Bishop Frank A. Rush is the 4th of 6 children born to this wonderful set of parents. Both his parents were proud graduates of A J. Moore High School!
            <br><br>
            All the Rush children are AJMHS alums: Rev. Otis L. Rush Jr. (1964); Sherryl Rush Johnson (1966); Lt. Cmdr. (R) Robert J. Rush Sr. (1968); Bishop Frank A. Rush (1970); Ronald C. Rush- Dec’d (1971); and Linda Rush Watkins (1973).
            <br><br>
            Bishop Rush served as 1970 Class President, which he calls “the Best Class!” He was a member of the Choir, Band and other organizations. He attended Texas Southern University (TSU) from 1970-72 on a Band Scholarship (trombone), pledged
            Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, and was named “Sophomore Of The Year!”
            <br><br>
            From 1972-74 Bishop Rush attended & graduated from U. C. Berkeley on a Crown-Zellerbach Scholarship with dual Bachelors Degrees in English & African-American Studies. He not only made the Dean’s List but graduated “with highest honors”.
            Rush attended Thurgood Marshall School of Law from 1974-77 on an Earl Warren Legal Training Scholarship and served as President of his graduating class.
            Bishop Rush was hired by the Law School upon graduation and served for 2 years as Placement Director from 1977-79. He was instrumental in getting TSU Law students hired all over America. The students & School honored him with the
            “Outstanding Placement Director Award” in 1979.
            <br><br>
            Rush practiced law in the Criminal, Personal Injury and Family Law fields from 1979-2022, and is licensed in State and Federal Courts. Recently, he retired after 43 years of practice. He is now considered “Emeritus” status with the State
            of Texas.
            <br><br>
            Bishop Rush was called into ministry by God in 1985 & preached his 1st Sermon on Feb. 9, 1986 at Mt. Horeb MBC under the outstanding leadership of Dr. S. H. Smith Sr. Title: “Message To Modern Man: I’ll Rise Again!” Rush calls Pastor
            Smith the “Best Pastor in America”, at the youthful age of 92!
            <br><br>
            Bishop Rush was installed as Pastor of True Missionary Baptist Church- now Houston Praise And Worship Center (HPWC) - on Oct. 9, 1987 and has served there continuously with his wife for life, Dr. JoAnn Vallie Rush, until her passing July
            25, 2021.
            <br><br>
            Bishop Rush is extremely thankful to God for the church & ministry help from his wife. Dr. Joann received 2 earned Masters and 2 earned Doctorates in Ministry and Theology. She is known internationally as an outstanding Praise Dance
            Teacher, Preacher & Praise Banner maker. She authored 13 books.
            <br><br>
            HPWC is an international Church with locations in America, Kenya, and Pakistan. Bishop Rush has been recognized by the State of Texas Legislature as a “Senior Religious Advisor”.
            <br><br>
            Having married his best friend and the love of his life (Joann) on July 10, 1976, the Rushes have been blessed with 2 wonderful children (Gerren & Cherish- both Teachers), amazing daughter-in-love (Monyce), and 3 wonderful grandchildren
            (Zoë-8, Calen-6, and Zuri - due in September).
            <br><br>
            Gerren is an author & both he and Cherish teach liturgical dance internationally. Monyce is a Licensed School Psychologist & owns a baking business. Zoë and Calen have advanced degree belts in Taekwondo.
            <br><br>
            Bishop Rush has received multiple Honorary Doctorate Degrees in Ministry, numerous Public Service Awards and has served in various organizations -like President of his Civic Club- aimed at improving the local community and mentoring.
            <br><br>
            His Church sponsors many activities but 2 of his favorites are the annual U. S. Armed Forces Day Celebration which grew from 25 Vendors last year to over 60 Vendors this year and included Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner as this year’s
            Keynote Speaker; and the newly- organized Royal Ambassadors Community School, which will pay the Teachers, but be FREE for students.
            <br><br>
            Rush is the 3rd of his siblings to speak at the A. J. Moore HS Reunion behind Rev. Otis Jr. and Sherryl. He is an author, song writer, poet, and has served as a News Paper Editor and Deejay. He and Dr. JoAnn co-hosted a highly rated
            Christian TV Show for several years.
            <br><br>
            Bishop Rush is most grateful to God for his salvation, Family, friends, journey and life purposes. He feels blessed to be called & used by God to serve & help others, especially those he calls “the least, the last, the lost and the
            unloved” with the love of Jesus Christ!

            Gerren Rush’s biggest passion is to encourage others to follow their dreams by reaching for his own. After four years of hard work, he released his first, self-published book in 2017, with a brand new book on Fatherhood, in the making.
            <br><br>
            Gerren’s love for people has led him throughout the United States and the Caribbean speaking about topics such as “Faith over Fear", “The Fatherhood Initiative,” Motherhood Initiative,” and “Giant Slayer,” along with “The Importance of
            Learning Styles.” Gerren welcomes audiences, great and small, with open arms.
            <br><br>
            Over the years, Gerren’s family has been his primary source of motivation. Gerren recently said to a large audience, “How can I seek to inspire students and my own children to reach for their dreams, if I haven’t done the same!” Gerren
            has made it his mission to continue to break the mold of what a teacher, author, speaker, creator and father can achieve. His goal is to show what one person can do when you set your mind to accomplish your goals.
